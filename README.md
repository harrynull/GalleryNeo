# GalleryNeo

Your favorite good ol' Shopify Code Challenge now comes in Kotlin!

Written with Kotlin, Springboot, MySQL, protobuf

## Deployment/Development

You need to have an SQL database (tested with MySQL 8.0) installed and change the configuration in `application.properties`.
Alternatively, change your environment variables `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_USERNAME`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_DB`.

Then, you can build it with `./gradlew build`

## License

That said, you are discouraged from using it for your own code challenge.
